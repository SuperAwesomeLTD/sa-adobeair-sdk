    - communicating with native methods

5.2.1
 - Updated the AIR SDK to communicate with the new Android (5.4.8) SDK. 
 - That removed the need to add layout and drawable resources to the build and changed slightly the Android manifest to change in your AIR project.
 - As a consequence all the UI elements are generated in code, even images (through base64 encoded strings).
 - This also adds a new and improved video player that is much more versatile.

5.2.0

 - All CPI calls now have a callback that lets the SDK user know if the Ad Server considered the install event to be valid or not.
 - Refactored some navtive method calls.

5.1.7
 - Updated the AIR SDK to be able to override iOS & Android native SDK version & sdk type. This means that all requests from the AIR SDK will be labeled as "air_x.y.z" instead of "android_x.y.z" or "ios_x.y.z", which in turn provide more accurate statistics for reporting.
 - Updated the method calls in each of the AIR-to-native methods so as to correspond to the new Android & iOS modular plugin structure.

5.1.6
 - Updated the main SDK classes to correspond to the new iOS and Android Plugins (for iOS 5.3.15 and Android 5.3.9)
 - Removed some internal enums such as SABannerSize that were causing problems
 - Added default values in the SuperAwesome singleton - now all SDK customizable values are initialised from those values. These should be kept in line with the iOS and Android ones.
