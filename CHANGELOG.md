CHANGELOG
=========

5.1.6
 - Updated the main SDK classes to correspond to the new iOS and Android Plugins (for iOS 5.3.15 and Android 5.3.9)
 - Removed some internal enums such as SABannerSize that were causing problems
 - Added default values in the SuperAwesome singleton - now all SDK customizable values are initialised from those values. These should be kept in line with the iOS and Android ones.
